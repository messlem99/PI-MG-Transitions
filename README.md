Claim-Level Evidence for Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Resilient Microgrids

This repository contains the complete coded evidence corpus used in the paper:

> Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Resilient Microgrid Dynamics and Control

The repository enables full replication, audit, and reuse of the claim-level synthesis presented in the paper.

## What this repository contains

Each **claim** corresponds to one method evaluated over one explicitly defined transition window, contingency regime, and enforcement locus. Claims, not papers, are the unit of evidence.

The dataset includes:

- Mapping from bibliographic works to claim units  
- Transition definitions (islanding, emergency islanded operation, restoration, reconnection)  
- Physics-injection mechanism classifications  
- Control-layer task assignments  
- Declared operational limits and stability semantics  
- Quantitative constraint and recovery outcomes  
- Robustness stress tests (topology, disturbance, observability, communication)  
- Validation fidelity tiers (F0–F3)  
- Auditability tiers (A0–A3)  
- Inter-rater annotations and reconciliation records
